# Brain_Tumor_Classification
This project classifies brain MRI images into four tumor types using deep learning. A custom CNN and MobileNetV2 (transfer learning) were built, with MobileNetV2 achieving higher accuracy. A Streamlit app was developed for real-time predictions, making the solution practical and user-friendly.
